Meeting minutes: 25.11.2024
 
What we prepared for the meeting
- initial simple analysis of the datasets
- calculated simple statistics for each dataset
- trained a simple regressor

What we presented to teacher
- the results of the trained regressor
- first hypothesis as to what affects the loading time
- our thoughts about further analysis of object types influencing the loading times

What questions we asked
- is our approach sound?

What feedback and answers we received
- use the other two datasets from the paper and see what happens
- calculate correlations between features
- we can't really compare loading times between batches -> we have to come up with a solution
- we should still experiment with other metrics
- try to remove the most important feature and see what happens etc.
- we can try and predict the loading speed of a 9th dataset (openaire-lod)
- if we keep the pace our work should be enough for the PoC for the next meeting
- final deliverable form:
    - github repository with open license
    - jupyter notebooks with some narrative

Our current project work plan
- for the next meeting (milestone):
    - proof of concept
    - incude the other two datasets
    - come up with a solution on how to handle batches
    - further analysis of how literals and other object types affect the loading speed
    - calculate correlations between features
    - try removing the most important feature etc.
    - apart from literal analysis calculate other metrics
    
- for the last meeting:
    - train linear regressor and comparison of results with the RandomForestRegressor
    - try and predict the loading speed of openaire-lod
    - finished analysis and conclusions based on what we have found

- for project delivery:
    - clean notebooks with our analysis and code to train the regressors
    - github repo with open license
    - presentation of our results
