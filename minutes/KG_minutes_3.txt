Meeting minutes: 09.12.2024
 
What we prepared for the meeting
- aggregated the data for all datasets
- additional analysis for the other two datasets
- linear regression experiment
- notebook with milestone progress which will be a part of the final notebook
- more thourough analysis of literls
- a more concrete hypothesis as to what really affects the loading speed (str_ratio/total_str_len)
- correlation analysis
- feature removal
- single feature predictions
- train/test split experiment
- initial prediction of speed for a held out dataset

What we presented to teacher
- linear regression experiment
- the milestone notebook containing a more thourough analysis
- more experiments and a new hypothesis

What questions we asked
- what might be the reason for linked spending to be faster than expected?

What feedback and answers we received
- we should normalise before calculating correlations
- linked-spending might have a lot of special characters -> bytes may give better results than character count
- in the extra experiment with linear regression, linear regression won't work alone for the averages
    -> we also need batches (and not take the average)


Our current project work plan
- for the last meeting:
    - investigate why linked spending doesn't follow the trend exactly
    - analyse more features
    - try to obtain better predictions for a held out dataset using total_str_len 
        and predict speed for openaire-lod dataset
        

- for project delivery:
    - clean notebooks with our analysis and code to train the regressors
    - github repo with open license
    - presentation of our results
